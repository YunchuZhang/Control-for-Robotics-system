Finally it could achieve human-robots interaction

The myrio control the motor part for rubik cube's rotate and denso is in charge of flipping and moving.

# To run the code
You need to run the myrio vi first and then run denso vi to wait the gripper move to a open position. After that you need to click the button in myrio vi to start the whole code. Also, you need to change the txt's path and content for certain trajectory and path.
